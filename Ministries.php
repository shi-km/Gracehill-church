The ministry and service teams provide a great way to serve and in this way, connect with the family. Although each of the teams have some requirements for joining, it is normally required that one has completed the NEW MEMBERS’ CLASS. 

              Finally, our teams are built on excellence, and that is required of anyone seeking to serve. </p>
