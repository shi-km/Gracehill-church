          “They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer…
          they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and
          sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those 
          who were being saved.”
